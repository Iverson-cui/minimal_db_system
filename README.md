# minimun_db_system
This is my implementation of a minimal database management system based on Learn C the Hard Way Ex17.
The ideal using case should be: there are files that keep your db data in your computer. Once you open the db, you load info from file to your computer cach. You can add, delete, set the rows in the db. Once done, load the db info back to the file and save it in your disk.
